P-SPHRAY.
==============

OpenMP for now.

CRASH scheme on a SPH densiy field.

Passes Illiev-test1 for isothermal field.

Source file format. Example.
-----------oxoxoxoxoxoxxo-------
# first line says how many sources there are
1
# what follows are locations(x,y,z), velocity(u,v,w), and luminosity/1e50, then two unused fields.

Atomic rate file format. Example (excerption)
the fields has to be in a straight fortran format. each number uses 14 bytes
exact.

COMPILATION
===========

first make libconfig in support/libconfig.

then make the main code in src/

the binary is psphray.
